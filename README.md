## Description:

Here I created a site where a user track there expenses whether they are online or offline. THe user can input a name and a dollar amount. The user then has to decide to add/deposit or subtract/withdraw this expense. This then populates a chart to showcase the history of all their expenses.

## Technologies Used:

- PWA
- Express
- MongoDB

## Things we learned:

- The figuring out where to start with this website was a bit challenging.Was not sure what direction to take. Once again my app runs locally but not on heroku. I still can't seem to get them to deploy.
